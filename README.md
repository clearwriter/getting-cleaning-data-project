# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

We're drawing from this dataset: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Ideally, when complete, the R script -- run_analysis.R -- will do the following:

1. It will merge the two datasets to create a single dataset.
2. It will extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. It will use descriptive activity names to identify the activities in the dataset.
4. It will appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. It will use the data in Step 4 to create a second, independent tidy dataset of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

`CodeBook.md` will describe the variables,  data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` will contain all code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. Import the file to RStudio.

The ultimate output is contained within `tidy.txt`, and uploaded to the course website for review and grading.
